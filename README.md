# CV-Application

A single-page resume or CV template application built to reinforce React props and state concepts, and refactored to use functional components and hooks.

## How to Use

Many fields are tab indexed, and new fields for each category can be generated by clicking on the field name (e.g., by clicking on "Skills").

## Structure

React components are separated into distinct files in a component folder. CSS files for each parent component are separated into unique files in a styles folder.
